By combining the paper wings in the crafting table with a cotton ball containing butterfly DNA of some kind will result in the production of butterfly wings which can used to decorate elytras or for display."

Simply right clicking any butterfly with a cotton ball will return you a cotton ball with the data of that butterfly smeared onto it."
